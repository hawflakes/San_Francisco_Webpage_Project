# Discover San Francisco

Discover San Francisco is a full stack web application that allows users to learn more about the city. Users can learn about the various neighborhoods and discover “things to do.” The Yelp API is used to display the top 5 most popular restaurants in each neighborhood and the Google Maps API is used to mark the location of each tourist attraction. Users can even contribute their thoughts by creating an account to comment and rate.

## Overview

Once a user lands on the homepage, he or she can click the "Let's Explore" button to view the list of neighborhoods in San Francisco. The neighborhoods and their data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. A map image marking the specific location of a popular tourist attraction is shown when the user lands on the "specific place" page. The map with the marker is populated using the Google Maps API. This API is called with an AJAX request inserting the location's latitude and longitude. Users can also view the top 5 most popular restaurants for each neighborhood. This list is populated when a request is made to the Yelp API to get a JSON response with the specific parameters. Logged in users can contribute their thoughts by leaving a comment. Their comments are stored in a PostgreSQL database and displayed on the webpage when the user clicks "submit." The submit button has an event listener so that an AJAX request can be made to get the JSONIFY-ed data.
